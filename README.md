CUDDLY HUGS.

CRAFTING CUDDLY COMPANIONS.

INTRODUCTION.


The Project:
Many people have a special place in their hearts for teddy bears because they represent coziness, nostalgia, and friendship. In order to provide a pleasurable user experience, this proposal seeks to provide an innovative online platform where users may purchase their own teddy bears, encouraging connection and personalization.
