Many people have a special place in their hearts for teddy bears because they represent coziness, nostalgia, and friendship. In order to provide a pleasurable user experience, this proposal seeks to provide an innovative online platform where users may purchase their own teddy bears, encouraging connection and personalization.

## TECHNOLOGY USED.

HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language): The backbone of the website, HTML provides the essential structure. I used semantic HTML elements to create a clean, organized content hierarchy, making it accessible and SEO-friendly.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): With CSS, I introduced elegance and responsiveness to the design. Utilizing Flexbox and Grid systems, I  crafted a fluid layout that adapts to various screen sizes. CSS animations were applied to enhance the user interaction, giving life to button hovers.
JavaScript (JS): JavaScript brought the teddy bears to life. Allowing users to select different colors and sizes of the teddy bear.
Architecture: The architecture is modular, separating concerns for maintainability and scalability. The front end interacts with a RESTful API, fetching data about teddy bears. I ensured cross-browser compatibility and used progressive enhancement strategies to provide a core experience for users with older browsers while enabling richer features for those with modern browsers.
